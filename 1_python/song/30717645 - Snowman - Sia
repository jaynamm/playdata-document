Don't cry snowman
not in front of me
Who will catch your tears
if you can't catch me darling
If you can't catch me darling
Don't cry snowman
don't leave me this way
A puddle of water
can't hold me close baby
Can't hold me close baby
I want you to know
that I'm never leaving
Cause I'm Mrs. Snow
'till death we'll be freezing
Yeah you are my home
my home for all seasons
So come on let's go
Let go below zero
And hide from the sun
I love you forever
Well we'll have some fun
Yes let's hit the North Pole
And live happily
Please don't cry no tears now
It's Christmas baby
My snowman and me yeah
My snowman and me baby
Don't cry snowman
don't you fear the sun
Who'll carry me
without legs to run honey
Without legs to run honey
Don't cry snowman
don't you shed a tear
Who'll hear my secrets
if you don't have ears baby
If you don't have ears baby
I want you to know
that I'm never leaving
Cause I'm Mrs. Snow
'till death we'll be freezing
Yeah you are my home
my home for all seasons
So come on let's go
Let's go below zero
And hide from the sun
I love you forever
Well we'll have some fun
Yes let's hit the North Pole
And live happily
Please don't cry no tears now
It's Christmas baby
My snowman and me yeah
My snowman and me baby
