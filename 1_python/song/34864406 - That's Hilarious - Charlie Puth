Look how all tables,
Look how all the tables have turned,
Guess you’re finally realizing how bad you messed it up
Girl you’re only making,
Girl you’re only making it worse,
When you call like you always do when you want someone

You took away a year,
of my fucking life and I can’t get it back no more
So when I see those tears,
Coming out your eyes I hope it’s me they're for

You didn’t love when you had me
But now you need me so badly
You can’t be serious
That’s hilarious
Thinking I would still want you
After the things you put me through
Yeah you’re delirious
That’s hilarious
 
Now you put the blame in,
Now you put the blame in reverse,
Tryina make me feel guilty for everything you’ve done
You’re another lesson,
You’re just another lesson I learned
Don’t give your heart to a girl who still got a broken one

You took away a year,
of my fucking life & I can’t get it back no more
So when I see those tears,
Coming out your eyes I hope it’s me they’re for 

You didn’t love when you had me
But now you need me so badly
You can’t be serious
That’s hilarious
Thinking I would still want you
After the things you put me through
Yeah you’re delirious
That’s hilarious
You didn’t love when you had me
But now you need me so badly
You can’t be serious (you can’t be serious)
That’s hilarious (that’s hilarious)
Thinking I would still want you
After the things you put me through
Yeah you’re delirious (delirious)
That’s hilarious (that’s hilarious)
